# ðŸ“ž Churn Prediction for ConnectSphere Telecom

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
ConnectSphere Telecom, a regional telecom provider, aims to **reduce customer churn** by predicting which customers are likely to leave.  
This project builds an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model to classify customers into:
- **Churn (Yes)** â€“ Likely to leave
- **No Churn (No)** â€“ Likely to stay

By identifying at-risk customers early, the company can implement **retention strategies** to improve customer loyalty.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop a **binary classification model** using ANN.
- Use customer usage data such as:
  - Call duration
  - Data usage
  - Contract length
  - Payment method, etc.
- Evaluate model performance with **Accuracy** and **F1-score**.
- Generate a list of customers likely to churn.

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. **Data Loading** â€“ Load dataset and inspect data.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handle missing values, convert datatypes.
3. **Encoding** â€“ Convert categorical variables into numerical form.
4. **Feature Scaling** â€“ Standardize features.
5. **Model Building** â€“ Create ANN with Keras.
6. **Model Training** â€“ Train model on training dataset.
7. **Evaluation** â€“ Use Accuracy and F1-score to assess performance.
8. **Prediction** â€“ Predict churn for unseen data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** ~85% (varies depending on hyperparameters)
- **F1-score:** ~0.82 (for churn class)
